## Hosting an Event
- ## [Host a Workshop :hammer_and_pick:](https://github.com/so-sc/war-room/issues/new?template=workshop.md)
  ### Understand the workshop Activities
  - **Spectogram** A group excercise to ignite a discussion by seperating people with similar interests into opposite sides based on a given question related to the context. Then the participants are asked to answer why did they choose the side.
  - **Think Pair Share** is a collaborative teaching strategy first proposed by Frank Lyman of the University of Maryland in 1981. It can be used to help students form individual ideas, discuss and share with the others in-group. It can be used before reading or teaching a concept and works better with smaller groups.
  - **Make The Quilt** Given a topic, students discuss together and build a concept/application/result together after learning the topics discussed or taught to them.
  - **Build As You Go** is an activity preferred for workshops where the speaker helps students learn concepts and build parts of a final project. At the end of the workshop students will be ready with a completed priject.
